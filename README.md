# Mini_project-1
this is my first Mini project (insurance claim prediction)

project is regarding prediction that a person will claim a insurance money or not.

ive tried few models like, logistic regression,SVM,DecisionTree,XgBoost but found the best result in RandomForestClassifier.

in python file ive shown two methods 1) RandomForestClassifier 2) RandomForestClassifier with HyperParameterTuning
with Hyper parameter tuning i got the best output
